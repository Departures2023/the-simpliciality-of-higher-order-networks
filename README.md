# The Simpliciality of Data

Some things:

* To run the unit tests, you need to pip install the package locally. Navigate to the local folder on your computer and run "pip install -e ."
* To run the unit tests, run "pytest" in the command line.
* The package is referenced as `sod` (Simpliciality of data) when accessing the functionality.
* There are also distance versions of some simpliciality measures in the code, but those are not currently used in the paper.
